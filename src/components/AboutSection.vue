        <p>
          I am a software developer with a passion for VR and game development, supported by a strong 
          foundation in C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript. I have experience with full-stack web development 
          using HTML, CSS, and modern frameworks, and I am skilled in working with databases like MySQL, 
          PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my background in software development and fitness, Iâ€™ve developed a blend of technical 
          expertise and soft skills like communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. Over the past few 
          years, I have expanded my skills to include VR and XR development, Unreal Engine, Unity, and 
          Blender, focusing on creating immersive experiences and efficient, scalable systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, I have also gained experience with mainframe technologies including COBOL, CICS, and 
          JCL â€” while valuable, my interests are primarily in modern web technologies, database engineering, 
          and the growing field of VR and XR applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am excited to apply my technical and creative skills to build innovative solutions and experiences, 
          particularly in the VR, gaming, and tech industries.
